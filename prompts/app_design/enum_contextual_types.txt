Cool! Now I need a similar enum, but with more contextualized 
and abstract data types. These include: name, surname, car model, 
main car license plate, postal address, residence country, postal code, 
country, city, IBAN, national ID, gender, email, education level, age, 
pet animal, score, mobile phone, home phone, and many more.

My goal is to create an application that allows users to store small 
pieces of data on their smartphones and, eventually, share them with 
others. To achieve this, it would be useful to have a predefined and 
extensive list of common data types that people might need to share at 
any moment!
